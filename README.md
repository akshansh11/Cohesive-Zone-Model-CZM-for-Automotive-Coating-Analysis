# Cohesive-Zone-Model-CZM-for-Automotive-Coating-Analysis

An innovative tool designed for researchers and engineers in the automotive coating industry. This app uses Cohesive Zone Models (CZM) to simulate and analyze the mechanical behavior of coatings, offering deep insights into adhesion, stress distribution, and fracture energy.

With real-time interactive visualizations, users can explore traction-separation curves, compare fracture energy across materials, and view stress distribution through dynamic contour maps. Built to be intuitive, this platform allows users to adjust key parameters and immediately see how coatings perform under different conditions. Whether for advanced research or practical applications, this app provides a powerful, user-friendly solution for coating analysis and optimization.
